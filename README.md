## Try it out

**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

**Launch the server**

Navigate to the `/server` directory and run

```bash
npm run start
```

The server will be launched locally and will start listening for requests.

**Previewing the scene**

On a separate command line window, avigate to the `/scene` directory, then run:

```bash
dcl start
```

Any dependencies are installed and then the CLI opens the scene in a new browser tab.
